### Background
Jenelys received her BSc in 2018 from the University of Puerto Rico, majoring in Cellular Molecular Biology. During her undergraduate studies, she was part of the NSF Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP), via which she started developing her bioinformatics skills. She also interned in Princeton University during the summer of 2017, where she got to work with RNA-seq data analysis.  Jenelys joined the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory School of Biological Sciences to pursue her PhD in 2018. There, her research focused on characterizing murine and human mammary gland organoid models in response to pregnancy hormones using single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). After her PhD studies, she went on to join the Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC) at Rockefeller University as a Bioinformatics Analyst and has been part of the team since October 2023. 

Jenelys primarily leads scRNA-seq data analysis projects in the BRC, and is interested in working with cutting edge single cell sequencing technologies and implementing novel analysis tools to enhance our understanding of complex biological processes. Jenelys is also interested in creating thorough and reproducible pipelines tailored to the individual needs of different scRNA-seq data sets. 

### Team role
Jenelys is a Bioinformatics Analyst focused on leading scRNA-seq data analysis projects at the Bioinformatics Resource Center in Rockefeller University.
